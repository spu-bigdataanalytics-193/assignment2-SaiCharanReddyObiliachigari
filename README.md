On this undertaking, we're purported to assist john through doing his two obligations: 
•	one to reduce the time of his mission wherein he become speculated to download one thousand photos from imgur, for this motive we have to first get the consumer id if you want to download the picture from imgur. Com. 
•	The postman app is used to create a customer identity. After creating the consumer id, we ought to download 731 pictures from imgur through the usage of john's codes. With the aid of doing so, it took 1 minute and 28 seconds.
•	so threading is supposed to lessen the time consequently when i used my code for multithreading on the identical system it reduces walltime to at least 11 seconds. Again, for resizing, john's code to resize 731 pics took 23. 
•	multiprocessing to reduce the time, so i used multiprocessing which took best 25.2 seconds on the identical gadget. 
•	For multithreading, i used threading module and defined a characteristic employee and ran the code using 10 employees. The one of a kind numbers for worker are attempted however with downloading 1000 pictures i reached the maximum downloading pix. The employee 10 become determined pleasant some of the other tries. 
•	For multiprocessing, i used "multiprocessing" module and used 7 pools and it ran the 9 parallel processing to perform the equal assignment. The other pool length much less than 9 and extra than 9 had been also used however the performance became discovered fine with minimum time for pool 7. 
•	For i/o bound operation multithreading and for cpu sure operation multiprocessing reduced the time significantly.
